# Trakkex

Trakkex is web-based application for tracking your budget in a simple way.
This is React-based expense tracking application.
Feel free to try demo here: https://trakkex.web.app/

## About

The app was created to fit my needs. No hussle, just add your income and expenses. That's it!
Eventually you're getting total of money which you currently own. Everytime you want to calculate budget - just go to trakkex, no need to check all your balances separately, since it is already done for you.

## Usage

Be aware, to be able to fully use the app you have to verify your email address. Otherwise you will be able to use in only in test mode where transactions are not saved.
For now, only HUF (Hungarian forint) is available and serves as a main currency of the app (however planning to add more features and currencies in future).
Just visit https://trakkex.web.app and you can start use it right away after registerting your account!
**Check your balance anytime, everywhere. Balance is hidden by default. Just click on it to show you the number!**

## Roadmap / Plans

For sure more currencies will be added in future to implement further features of the app. There is a plan to implement a Profile where user will be able to choose his own main currency, profile photo, change password etc. As soon as more currencies are implemented user will be able to choose a transaction in different currencies which will be automatically converted to the main account currency (by default transaction will be saved in main currency as well). More to come!
